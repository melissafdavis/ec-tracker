#### EC Observation Tracker
This is a web based tracking app for parents doing elimination communication (infant potty training) with their infants and toddlers.



#### Notes 
The app is not styled yet. First I'm working on functionality but will come back to styling soon.


#### Functionality that I've more or less finished: 
1. Recording events accurately and in the correct places on the timeline
2. Storing data in local storage
3. Timeline events persist past screen refresh

#### Functionality that I'm working on:


1. Recording and posting a daily tally of catches and misses in the timeline
2. Adding a delete button for events
3. Adding graphs/charts

#### Desired feedback:
1. How can I accomplish what I've already done more succinctly and efficiently?
2. What bugs do you see and how can I fix them?
