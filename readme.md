#### EC Observation Tracker
This is a web based tracking app for parents doing elimination communication (infant potty training) with their infants and toddlers.

#### Purpose:
Periodically EC parents take time to observe their child's patterns for a number of days in order to improve their practice. The goal of this app is for parents to be able to use this tracker for a 7 day observation period to record all potty misses and catches.

#### Note about stying: 
The app is not styled yet. I'm focused solely on functionality right now but will return to styling concerns later.

#### Functionality that I've more or less finished: 
Recording events accurately and in the correct places on the timeline

#### Functionality that I'm working on:
Dynamically renaming names of buttons to reflect initial date selected by user (example: March 15 instead of Day 1 )
Storing data in local storage
Having the timeline events persist past screen refresh
Recording and posting a daily tally of catches and misses
Feeding the correct data into the bar graph

#### Desired feedback:
How can I accomplish what I've already done more succinctly and efficiently?
What bugs do you see and how can I fix them?
